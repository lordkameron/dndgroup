							<div class="text">Alexander Zapruder is the grandson of yes, THAT Zapruder. At 41, he's the senior member of the Bablyon crew. His obsession with conspiracies (these aren't theories, these are facts) started with before his conception, with his Grandfather's proof that the assassination of JFK was, in fact, a hit by the CIA. Since then, his family has been devoted to exposing, the CIA for what it really is: a domestic terror organization run by the Illuminati. What does this have to do with monsters? He has to make sure the Illuminati can't weaponize them.</div>

							<img class="charCard" alt="Malkita: Apocalyptic Hellhound" src="art/CharCard/Mal2Card_Miffix.jpg">
							<div class="text">Mal was brought back by the summoning ritual. They had a human sacrifice that was being burned alive to summon him. The similar pain the victim was feeling was powerful enough to be felt between two plains and is what brought him specifically. The agony of the victim and the vile intentions of those making the sacrifice brought him into the world in an explosion of screaming and burning flesh. The fire of the explosion killed all those trying to perform the ritual. They didn't intend to die, and had no idea that rush of emotion he felt coming back into the world in a fight or flight state would cause a reaction on that scale. He never found out why they did it or what they wanted, just that he was there and immediately got a taste anger, blood, and hate that he felt when he died. Mal and Phey met shortly after Malkita was summoned. He was weak still from being new to the world and fought with another monster. Phey found them fighting and saved him involuntarily by restraining the other monster with magic, this being the first encounter she actually used her newfound runes on. He landed a killing blow and survived, but wound up a blood soaked unstable mess that she took pity on and nursed to health with some secret help from Matilda (Rene was kept in the dark on Mal until they came out as a couple). That was the first time Mal had encountered compassion, and reluctantly at first they earned each otherâ€™s trust.</div>
